# Azizi Life: Carbon Footprint Analysis

This project, in collaboration with students from the **University of Manchester** as part of the 2024 international volunteer program, analyzes the carbon footprint of Azizi Life's woven products and impact initiatives. These initiatives include solar lights, water filters, and fuel-efficient stoves, aimed at reducing carbon emissions and improving community health.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To measure the carbon emissions from Azizi Life's 12‚Äù Woven Bowl and calculate how much  the carbon is saved from Azizi life Initiatives of  fuel efficient stoves and water Filters.
- **Collaboration**: Worked closely with students from the University of Manchester to design the research methodology and conduct field surveys.
- **Data Collection**: We developed the research methodology and collected data through surveys from local artisans, focusing on energy consumption, transportation, production processes, and health impacts of the initiatives.
- **Carbon Footprint Calculation**: Emissions were calculated based on raw materials, energy use, and transportation involved in the production process.

## Key Outcomes
- Quantified the carbon footprint of Azizi Life's woven bowls.
- Measured carbon savings from solar lights, water filters, and fuel-efficient stoves.
- Assessed the health benefits for local artisans using sustainable technologies.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data analysis and calculations.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for initial data collection and analysis.
- **Canvas, KoboToolbox**: For data visualization, survey collection, and analysis.

## Future Work
The results from this analysis will inform future sustainability projects and serve as a communication tool for Azizi Life to share with donors and customers about their environmental impact.
